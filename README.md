  **In this project we make build of Multiple-Linear-Regression model to predict Salary based on different level given in the dataset**.<br></br>
  Multiple linear regression (MLR) is used to determine a mathematical relationship among several random variables.
  In other terms, MLR examines how multiple independent variables are related to one dependent variable.
  Go through the dataset first to explore the dependent and independent variable.
